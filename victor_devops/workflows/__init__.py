"""DevOps vertical workflows.

This package provides workflow definitions for common DevOps tasks:
- Infrastructure deployment
- Container management
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Monitoring configuration

Uses YAML-first architecture with Python escape hatches for complex conditions
and transforms that cannot be expressed in YAML.

Example:
    provider = DevOpsWorkflowProvider()

    # Compile and execute (recommended - uses UnifiedWorkflowCompiler with caching)
    result = await provider.run_compiled_workflow("deploy", {"env": "prod"})

    # Stream execution with real-time progress
    async for node_id, state in provider.stream_compiled_workflow("deploy", context):
        print(f"Completed: {node_id}")

Available workflows (all YAML-defined):
- deploy: Safe deployment with validation and rollback
- cicd: CI/CD pipeline with security scanning
- container_setup: Container setup with Dockerfile optimization
- container_quick: Quick container build
